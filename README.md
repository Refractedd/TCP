# TCP Server / Client Python
This project was made by Benjamin Williams for Telecommunications course at Texas Tech University
## Waat does it do?
These 2 programs can be placed on different devices to create a TCP (Transfer Control Protocol) Connection
Currently configured for localhost, but can be reconfigured with a known IP to work across devices.
TCP is the most reliable data transfer protocol so this program uses try-catch expressions to catch errors and prevent them from interupting the connection.
